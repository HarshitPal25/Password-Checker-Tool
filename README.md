##  How It Works

The program evaluates the password based on 4 criteria:

1. Contains lowercase letters
2. Contains uppercase letters
3. Contains digits
4. Contains special characters

The total score (0â€“4) is combined with the password length to determine strength:

| Score | Length        | Strength     |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| 4     | â‰¥ 12 chars    | Strong       |
| â‰¥ 3   | â‰¥ 8 chars     | Medium       |
| â‰¥ 2   | â‰¥ 6 chars     | Weak         |
| < 2   | < 6 chars     | Very Weak    |
